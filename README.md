# Travel Tracking App

A site for tracking your past and pending travels. When logged in, the user will also be able to make a new trip request.

## Background/About

Being able to see past and pending trips, with the estimated cost for each trip is key to staying organized. Using data fetched from an API, this application simulates a travel app, where the user that logs in can view past/pending trips and make a new trip request.

## APIs Used
- Travel Tracker API

## Primary Technologies Used
- Webpack
- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- Mocha Testing Framework & Chai Assertion Library

## Next Steps
Additional enhancements could include:
- Add an upcoming trips section, when trips are 'approved' and have a future date
- Allow users to filter based on different fields
